\doxysubsection{Подробное описание}
Implements a container for rotation information.

All rotation values are stored in degrees.

The angles are interpreted as intrinsic rotations applied in the order Yaw, then Pitch, then Roll. I.\+e., an object would be rotated first by the specified yaw around its up axis (with positive angles interpreted as clockwise when viewed from above, along -\/Z), then pitched around its (new) right axis (with positive angles interpreted as \textquotesingle{}nose up\textquotesingle{}, i.\+e. clockwise when viewed along +Y), and then finally rolled around its (final) forward axis (with positive angles interpreted as clockwise rotations when viewed along +X).

Note that these conventions differ from quaternion axis/angle. UE Quat always considers a positive angle to be a left-\/handed rotation, whereas Rotator treats yaw as left-\/handed but pitch and roll as right-\/handed.
